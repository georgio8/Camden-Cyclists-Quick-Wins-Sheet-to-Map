Development plans for Sheet-to-map
==================================

V1.
Implement 'Hover' to show contents of markers

Accept URL parameters for:
- the Google Sheet URL
- the column that has a GMap URL
- the set of columns to form the contents of the Pop-up (and a subset to be shown on Hover)
- map style (?)

V2. 
Update the GSheet with rows added from user input on the map.
