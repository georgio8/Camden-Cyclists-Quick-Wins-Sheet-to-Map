**Tool for generating an interactive map from a Google Sheet**

Developed from a Mapbox Sheet-to-Map demo.



First deployment here:
http://camdencyclists.org.uk/suggested-covid-19-highway-interventions/

It would be great to get a degree of integration with this much higher-level
tool: https://github.com/cyipt/tempCycleways  E.g. use it to generate rows for a
GSheet
