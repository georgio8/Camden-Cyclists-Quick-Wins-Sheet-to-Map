MapBox Sheet-to-map code for showing Camden's Quick Wins as a MapBox Sheet-to-Map from a Google Sheet.

Early release deployed here: http://camdencyclists.org.uk/suggested-covid-19-highway-interventions/

It would be great to get a degree of integration with this much higher-level tool: https://github.com/cyipt/tempCycleways 
E.g. use it to generate rows for a GSheet
